            <p class="Education">As an undergraduate, I majored in physics with a concentration in
              quantitative finance – a newly established joint venture between UNC’s
              Department of Physics and the Kenan-Flagler Business School. The major allowed me to study the fundamental nature of our surroundings through physics, as well as learn and work in a truly unique multidisciplinary fashion. In all, my coursework covered a wide range of fields including physics, math, business, computer science, economics, and the humanities.
              <br><br>
              I studied abroad in Spain for my entire sophomore year. The primary purpose of this escapade was to achieve a longtime personal goal of fluency in Spanish – a goal I completed by the time I came back stateside. I studied at two universities in Sevilla, Spain, one public and one private, to experience the differences in the Spanish education system.

            <p class="Education">The Universidad de Sevilla is a public university in Seville, Spain. Separated into different “Facultads,” or departments, it is one of the top-ranked universities in Spain. I took courses in the economics department, or “Facultad de Ciencias Económicas y Empresariales.” Specifically, I took a second-year macroeconomics course and a fourth-year environmental economics course. Interestingly, courses here were graded solely on a final exam. If test-takers achieved a 5 or above (out of 10) on the test, they passed. Also important to note, the café in the economics building served the best cañas de chocolate!

                    I took classes here in Spanish with other UNC students, taught by proprietary professors. These classes included, Spanish literature and grammar, Spanish history, and a phonetics and phonology course.

              During the summer of 2017, I backpacked for a month in the Canadian Yukon. Immersed in sweeping landscapes and exotic wildlife, I developed my leadership and survival skills with 14 other students. For the last week of the program, the group was split in two and challenged to operate without the presence of instructors. I was chosen as one of the group’s leaders by the other students and instructors.

            <p class="workContent">In the summer of 2018, I worked for a quantitative hedge fund called Graham Capital Management. While there, I performed analysis of competitor portfolios by combing through their SEC filings and determining the relative sector exposures. I am proud to say this analysis was forwarded to the president of the company. Additionally, I created 30-year benchmark indices in all four market sectors. While they were hypothetical portfolios, they all were uniquely optimized using different portfolio optimization techniques. These techniques included Equal Volatility, Minimum Variance, Maximum Principal Component, and Equal Risk Contribution. In all of my work, I used Python (Pandas and Numpy) and Excel.

        <h4 class="extra">Python(Shapely)</h4>
        <p class="extra">
          As crime in Chapel Hill has risen in the month of September, and University leadership attempts to address it with improved notification and response rates, I want to see if this crime can be modeled using a Poisson distribution. To do this, I focus on two specific, homogenous neighborhoods that have not changed significantly over the last decade – Chapel Hill Northside and Franklin Street. I then divide the crime reports into two groups: from 2011-2015 and from 2015-2019. (Before 2011, the data is sparse). Dividing the neighborhoods into small sectors and using the intensity lambda as the average number of crimes per sector, I will see if the Poisson distribution from the first group maps to that of the second group accurately. If it does, we might be able to infer that the Poisson distribution from the last four years maps to the next four years in these neighborhoods as well.

            I have played on the UNC Club Squash Team throughout my time at Carolina. As a freshman, I played number 2 on the ladder and finished the season with an 11-game winning streak. Thanks to the captain at the time and the other dedicated players, we were able to bring this team to
            the Collegiate National Championship for the first time in many years. While I redshirted my sophomore year in Spain, my junior and senior years I became more active within the leadership of the team. In these two years, Carolina Squash rose to greater prominence within the University and nationally. My senior year, the team finished with its highest rating in my time at UNC and capped off the season with a big win against Duke, woohoo!

Moreover, many of the projects required external data, and I came to appreciate the importance of data-driven projects.
